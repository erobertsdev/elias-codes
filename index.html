                        Everything the title says is true.  This is simply to mark the day I've begun this project and get a feel for how the layout will work.
                        This site will eventually be separated into sections depending on which topic the post is about, thus the menu, and include "likes" 
                        and comments. I'll be posting about coding skills/challenges, IT certification studies/skills, graphic design, and whatever else floats my fancy.
                        The posts will be held in a database, not just this hardcoded nonsense. Will anyone ever visit this site? Who knows! 
                        The point really is just to document my learning and maybe accidentally help someone in the process.
